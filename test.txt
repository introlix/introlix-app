Difference between Python and JavaScript
Last Updated :

Python and JavaScript are both popular programming languages, each with distinct features. Python emphasizes readability and simplicity, ideal for tasks like data analysis and backend development, while JavaScript is primarily used for web development, offering dynamic and interactive functionality directly in web browsers.
Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Widely used in web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and automation due to its versatility and ease of use.
Example: This is a simple Python program to print "Hello World".
Python
# Python program to print 'Hello world'
print("Hello World")
Output:
Hello World
Benefits of Python
- It is a high-level Object-oriented language having user-friendly data structures.
- Open source and community development.
- It is versatile, easy to read, learn and write.
- It supports an extensive range of libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics, etc).
- It is a dynamically typed language ie., there is no need to mention data type based on the value assigned, it takes data type.
- Ideal for prototypes – provide more functionality with less coding
- Highly Efficient(Python’s clean object-oriented design provides enhanced process control, and the language is equipped with excellent text processing and integration capabilities, as well as its own unit testing framework, which makes it more efficient.)
Drawbacks of Python
- Limited performance for CPU-intensive tasks due to its interpreted nature.
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts multi-threading efficiency.
- Dependency management can be challenging with conflicting versions.
- Less suitable for mobile app development compared to languages like Java or Swift.
- Limited support for low-level system programming compared to C/C++.
- Slower execution speed compared to compiled languages like C++ or Rust.
- Difficulty in creating standalone executables without additional tools.
JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for web development. It enables dynamic and interactive content on websites, runs client-side scripts in web browsers, and server-side scripts via platforms like Node.js.
Example: This is a simple program that will print "Hello World" using Javascript.
JavaScript
// JavaScript program to print 'Hello world'
<script>
console.log('Hello World');
</script>
Output:
"Hello World"
Benefits of JavaScript
- JavaScript has the ability to support all modern browsers and produce an equivalent result.
- Global companies support community development by creating projects that are important. An example is Google (created Angular framework) or Facebook (created the React.js framework).
- Regardless of where you host JavaScript, it always gets executed on the client environment to save lots of bandwidth and make the execution process fast.
- In JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest is an important object that was designed by Microsoft. The object calls made by XMLHttpRequest as an asynchronous HTTP request to the server to transfer the data to both sides without reloading the page.
Drawbacks of JavaScript
- Asynchronous programming can lead to complex callback and promise chains, increasing code complexity.
- Lack of strong typing can lead to runtime errors that might be caught at compile time in statically typed languages.
- Different behavior in different browsers can lead to cross-browser compatibility issues.
- Limited support for multithreading due to its single-threaded nature.
- Debugging can be challenging due to dynamic typing and prototypal inheritance.
- Lack of built-in module management system before ES6, leading to dependency management challenges.
- Less suitable for CPU-intensive tasks compared to languages like Python or C++.
Difference between Python and JavaScript
There are significant differences for both of them, which are discussed below:
S.no. | Python | JavaScript |
|---|
| 1. | Python is a high-level general-purpose interpreted programming language that was developed to emphasize code readability.
| JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
|
| 2. | It is a scripting language used for developing both desktop and web applications.
| It is a client-side scripting language.
|
| 3. | It uses a class-based inheritance model.
| It uses a prototype-based inheritance model.
|
| 4. | In this, an exception is raised when the function is called with the wrong parameters.
| It does not care about the functions are called with correct parameters or not.
|
| 5. | List, set, and dict are mutable while int, tuple, bool, Unicode are immutable in python.
| In JavaScript, only objects and arrays are mutable.
|
| 6. | It uses a more conservative programming paradigm similar to C, C++, and Java.
| It is a language of the web browser and one of the easiest to use.
|
| 7. | It has a comprehensive standard library.
| It has a limited set of utility objects.
