Introlix Research is a platform for researchers, students and those people who want to do deep research or learn something deeply.

# Features:
- **Run locally or in the cloud**: Use LLMs either on your own machine or through the cloud.
- **Flexible input**: Upload PDFs/documents or simply provide a prompt, and the platform will conduct the research for you.
- **Multi-agent system**: Supports both deep research and quick, shallow searches.
- **Dynamic control**: Users can adjust the research direction at any point.
Research paper ready: At the end, results can be transformed into a full research paper.
- **Work independently or collaboratively**: Users can carry out their own research while the LLMs prepare a report in parallel.
- **AI-assisted research**: Conduct research directly on the platform with AI as an assistant.

# How It will work:
**Step 1**: Write your prompt and upload any supporting files (if needed). Supporting files can contain previous research or work.

**Step 2**: The system (LLMs) generates a proposed plan of action.

**Step 3**: Review and edit the plan of action as desired.

**Step 4**: Questions are automatically prepared based on the plan.

**Step 5**: Review and refine the questions.

**Step 6**: A web search begins. High-quality articles are selected based on the questions.
- If the “Show summaries” option is enabled, article summaries will also be displayed.
- More relevant articles are ranked higher, while less relevant ones appear lower in the list.
- Users can ask questions about specific articles, remove them, or add new sources.

**Step 7**: Deep research is conducted on the selected articles.

**Step 8**: Additional questions are generated from the research.
- Users can add new questions or enable “Fully Automate” to let the process continue without interruption.
- Steps 6 and 7 repeat until a conclusion is reached, or the user decides to stop.
- When results and summaries are shown, users may still ask questions, add new ones, or include new sources. 

**Step 9**: A comprehensive research report is generated from the results after fact checking.

**Step 10**: Users can further refine the output into a full research paper.


# Multi Agent System
**Planner Agent**: Prepares structured plans of action and generates initial questions to guide the research process.


**Explorer Agents (multiple in parallel)**: Search the web for relevant articles, papers, and sources. They also create summaries for users to quickly review and filter content.

**Verifier Agent**: Acts as a fact-checker, validating information, cross-referencing multiple sources, and refining the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

**Researcher Agent**: Conducts in-depth analysis and synthesizes findings into high-quality research outputs.
